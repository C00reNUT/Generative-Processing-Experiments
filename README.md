# Processing Experiments 

The following experiments are various creative processing inits I've played with in the past couple of months. Some of them are simply experiments that I've ported from other wonderful peoples. 

## BrushFade 
Is my most recent and found it to be the most fun to create as it has a number of different elements that I combined to generate.
